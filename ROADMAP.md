# SpecLang Portal & Ecosystem Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the SpecLang Portal and the broader SpecLang ecosystem, including planned tools and resources.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Iterative Development:** Features and tools will be developed iteratively, focusing on delivering value incrementally.
*   **Community Focus (Future):** Long-term, aim to build a community around SpecLang, encouraging contributions and feedback.
*   **Modularity:** Design tools and libraries to be modular and potentially interoperable.

## Phase 0: Foundation (Completed)

*   **SpecLang Portal v1.0:**
    *   Educational content on SpecLang Philosophy, Workflow, Guidelines, and Future Directions.
    *   Interactive Demo using Google Gemini API for NL-to-Spec generation.
    *   Initial list of conceptual Resources and Tools.
    *   Basic project structure and README.

## Phase 1: Portal Enhancement & Tool Specification (Next 3-6 Months)

*   **SpecLang Portal v1.1:**
    *   **UI/UX Refinements:** Improve overall user experience, navigation, and visual appeal based on feedback.
    *   **Enhanced Content:** Expand on existing content with more examples, use cases, and FAQs.
    *   **Improved Demo:**
        *   Allow users to see and perhaps lightly edit the prompt sent to the Gemini API.
        *   Provide options for different types of spec outputs (e.g., more detailed, more high-level).
*   **Conceptual Tool Detailing (Project Structure Initiated):**
    *   **`resources/spec-validator-cli/README.md`**: Detailed specification and feature list.
    *   **`resources/nl-to-spec-core-library/README.md`**: API design and core functionalities defined.
    *   **`resources/spec-ui-mapper-sdk/README.md`**: Scope and integration points identified.
    *   **`resources/intent-driven-development-book/README.md`**: Outline and chapter structure created.
*   **Begin Prototyping `NL-to-Spec Core Library`:**
    *   Develop initial proof-of-concept for the library, focusing on robust prompt engineering and parsing AI outputs for SpecLang structure.
    *   Address common challenges in NL understanding identified in existing tools, such as handling ambiguity and ensuring robustness for diverse inputs (informed by `research/deep-search-1.md`).
*   **Assimilation of External Research:**
    *   Continuously integrate findings from `RESEARCH.md` deep-search results into project documentation, tool specifications, and portal content.

## Phase 2: Core Tool Development & Early Content Creation (6-12 Months)

*   **`NL-to-Spec Core Library` v0.1 (Alpha):**
    *   Release an initial version for internal testing and use in other tools.
    *   Focus on core translation capabilities, acknowledging the complexities of achieving high accuracy with varied NL inputs (as seen in the landscape analysis).
*   **`SpecValidator CLI` v0.1 (Alpha):**
    *   Develop basic linting and structural validation features.
    *   Its design and feature set will be informed by understanding common pitfalls in NL interpretation and specification quality observed in the broader tool landscape (as per `research/deep-search-1.md`), aiming to preemptively address these issues.
*   **"Intent-Driven Development: The SpecLang Approach" - Early Drafts:**
    *   Begin writing initial chapters of the book.
*   **Portal v1.2:**
    *   Integrate a "Blog" or "Updates" section for news on SpecLang development.
    *   Potentially showcase outputs from early versions of the tools.

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion & Beta Releases (12-18 Months)

*   **`Spec-UI-Mapper SDK` v0.1 (Proof of Concept):**
    *   Develop a prototype demonstrating mapping from a spec to a simple UI representation for one framework, incorporating learnings from existing NL-to-UI tools (as per `deep-search-1.md`) by focusing on core layout interpretation from SpecLang's structured format for a target UI representation and acknowledging the challenges observed in the broader landscape.
*   **`NL-to-Spec Core Library` v0.5 (Beta):**
    *   Incorporate feedback and add more advanced features.
*   **`SpecValidator CLI` v0.5 (Beta):**
    *   Add more sophisticated analysis capabilities and reporting, continually refining its rules based on insights from the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of similar quality control mechanisms in other NL-to-X systems (`research/deep-search-1.md`).
*   **Book Progress:** Continue writing and refining content for "Intent-Driven Development."
*   **Community Building:**
    *   Establish a GitHub organization for SpecLang projects.
    *   Create discussion forums or channels.

## Phase 4: Maturation & Wider Adoption (18+ Months)

*   **Tooling v1.0 Releases:** Stable releases of core SpecLang tools.
*   **Published Book:** Release "Intent-Driven Development: The SpecLang Approach."
*   **Expanded Portal:**
    *   Include detailed documentation for all SpecLang tools and libraries.
    *   Showcase community projects and contributions.
*   **Explore Advanced Features:**
    *   Deeper integration with IDEs.
    *   Bi-directional spec-to-code/UI synchronization explorations, drawing from ongoing research into Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), traceability techniques, AI-assisted synchronization, and conflict resolution strategies (informed by findings like those in `deep-search-3.md`).
    *   Research on more advanced AI capabilities for spec generation and analysis.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns (Ongoing)

*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation for all aspects of SpecLang and its tools.
*   **Testing:** Robust testing strategies for libraries and tools.
*   **User Feedback:** Continuously gather and incorporate user feedback into the development process.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the portal and documentation are accessible.

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.
